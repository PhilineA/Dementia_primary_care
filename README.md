This repository contains the python scripts used for my (Philine Adolfsen) Minor Research Project titled: "The ABOARD-GP cohort: using real-world primary care data to study the diagnosis and
management of dementia"

The increasing number of persons with dementia underscores the need for early detection and comprehensive understanding of the landscape of dementia and patient characteristics. Real-world data (RWD) could provide valuable insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of dementia. This study aimed to create the “A personalized Medicine Approach for Alzheimer’s Disease” GP cohort (ABOARD-GP Cohort) including persons with dementia and individuals suffering from MCI using RWD from the PHARMO Data Network. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive overview of the cohort’s demographics, representativeness, comorbidities, comedications, and linkages to other data sources. Using these study objectives we aim to answer the following research questions: Can the ABOARD-GP Cohort represent dementia and MCI patients in primary care settings, and how does it compare to existing literature in terms of patient demographics, comorbidities, comedications, and prevalence rates to the Dutch population? How can the ABOARD-GP Cohort be further enriched by linking to additional data sources?

Access to the data from the ABOARD-GP Cohort is possible for researchers. After approval of a data request by the steering committee of the ABOARD-GP Cohort, a collaboration agreement will be signed, and access to the data can be obtained via a virtual machine (VM). For more information, please contact the PHARMO Institute for Drug Outcomes Research (https://www.pharmo.nl). The Python scripts used for data visualization in this study are stored in this repository:

The script "patients_overtime.py" provides data visualization for the number of dementia patients in the PARMO GP Data Network over the years during the study period (2011-2022).

The script "CED_over_years.py" provides data visualization for the number of newly diagnosed dementia patients over the years during th study period (2011-2022).
